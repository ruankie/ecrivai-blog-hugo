How Laughter Benefits Your Health
There are many ways that laughter can benefit your health. Here are a few of the most common:

Reduces stress. Laughter has been shown to reduce the levels of stress hormones in the body, such as cortisol and adrenaline. This can lead to a number of benefits, including lower blood pressure, improved sleep, and reduced anxiety.
Improves mood. Laughter can also help to improve mood and reduce symptoms of depression. This is because laughter releases endorphins, which have mood-boosting effects.
Boosts the immune system. Laughter has been shown to boost the immune system by increasing the production of white blood cells. This can help to protect the body from infection and disease.
Relieves pain. Laughter can also help to relieve pain by blocking the pain signals from reaching the brain. This can be helpful for people who are experiencing chronic pain or pain from injuries.
