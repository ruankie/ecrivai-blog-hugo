1. Controlled-Release Fertilizers:
Controlled-release fertilizers (CRFs) gradually release nutrients over an extended period, providing a consistent supply to plants. This reduces nutrient leaching, minimizes environmental impact, and improves crop growth and yield. Examples of CRFs include coated fertilizers, polymer-coated fertilizers, and slow-release nitrogen fertilizers."><meta name=author content="EcrivAI"><link rel=canonical href=https://ruankie.github.io/ecrivai-blog-hugo/posts/202410080042/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/ecrivai-blog-hugo/assets/css/stylesheet.css rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><script defer crossorigin=anonymous src=/ecrivai-blog-hugo/assets/js/highlight.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script><link rel=icon href=https://ruankie.github.io/ecrivai-blog-hugo/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://ruankie.github.io/ecrivai-blog-hugo/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://ruankie.github.io/ecrivai-blog-hugo/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://ruankie.github.io/ecrivai-blog-hugo/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://ruankie.github.io/ecrivai-blog-hugo/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://ruankie.github.io/ecrivai-blog-hugo/posts/202410080042/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--hljs-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51)}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><meta property="og:title" content="Advanced Nutrient Delivery Systems: The Key to Enhanced Crop Production"><meta property="og:description" content="Introduction:
