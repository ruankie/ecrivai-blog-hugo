What Causes Sleep Paralysis? Sleep paralysis occurs when the brain is in a state of transition between sleep and wakefulness. During sleep, the brain produces a chemical called gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which inhibits movement."><meta name=author content="EcrivAI"><link rel=canonical href=https://ruankie.github.io/ecrivai-blog-hugo/posts/202408120040/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/ecrivai-blog-hugo/assets/css/stylesheet.css rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><script defer crossorigin=anonymous src=/ecrivai-blog-hugo/assets/js/highlight.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script><link rel=icon href=https://ruankie.github.io/ecrivai-blog-hugo/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://ruankie.github.io/ecrivai-blog-hugo/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://ruankie.github.io/ecrivai-blog-hugo/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://ruankie.github.io/ecrivai-blog-hugo/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://ruankie.github.io/ecrivai-blog-hugo/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://ruankie.github.io/ecrivai-blog-hugo/posts/202408120040/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--hljs-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51)}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><meta property="og:title" content="The Surprising Science Behind Sleep Paralysis"><meta property="og:description" content="Sleep paralysis is a temporary inability to move or speak that occurs while falling asleep or waking up.

It is a common experience, affecting up to 40% of the population. While it can be a frightening experience, sleep paralysis is generally harmless and lasts only a few seconds or minutes.\nWhat Causes Sleep Paralysis? Sleep paralysis occurs when the brain is in a state of transition between sleep and wakefulness. During sleep, the brain produces a chemical called gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which inhibits movement. When we wake up, GABA levels decrease, allowing us to move freely. However, if GABA levels remain high during the transition to wakefulness, it can cause temporary paralysis.\nSleep paralysis can also be triggered by certain factors, such as:\nSleep deprivation: When we are sleep-deprived, our GABA levels are higher, making us more likely to experience sleep paralysis. Certain medications: Some medications, such as antidepressants and antipsychotics, can increase GABA levels and trigger sleep paralysis. Alcohol and drug use: Alcohol and drugs can interfere with sleep and increase the risk of sleep paralysis. Mental health conditions: People with certain mental health conditions, such as anxiety and PTSD, are more likely to experience sleep paralysis. Narcolepsy: Narcolepsy is a neurological disorder that causes excessive daytime sleepiness. People with narcolepsy are more likely to experience sleep paralysis. Symptoms of Sleep Paralysis The most common symptoms of sleep paralysis include:\nTemporary inability to move or speak: This is the hallmark symptom of sleep paralysis. It can last for a few seconds or minutes. Hallucinations: Some people experience hallucinations during sleep paralysis. These hallucinations can be visual, auditory, or tactile. A sense of pressure on the chest: This can feel like someone is sitting on your chest. Difficulty breathing: This can be a frightening symptom, but it is usually not life-threatening. Fear and anxiety: Sleep paralysis can be a frightening experience, especially if it is accompanied by hallucinations. How to Overcome Sleep Paralysis If you experience sleep paralysis, there are a few things you can do to overcome it:\nTry to relax: This can be difficult, but it is important to stay calm and relaxed. The more you panic, the longer the episode will last. Focus on moving your body: Even if you can’t move your entire body, try to wiggle your fingers or toes. This can help to break the paralysis. Try to speak: If you can’t move your body, try to speak. This can also help to break the paralysis. Don’t fight it: Fighting sleep paralysis will only make it worse. Instead, try to accept it and wait for it to pass. Get enough sleep: Sleep deprivation is a major risk factor for sleep paralysis. Getting enough sleep can help to reduce your risk of experiencing it. Avoid alcohol and drugs: Alcohol and drugs can interfere with sleep and increase your risk of sleep paralysis. Talk to your doctor: If you experience sleep paralysis frequently, talk to your doctor. They can help you to determine if there is an underlying medical condition that is causing it and recommend treatment options. Conclusion Sleep paralysis is a common experience that can be frightening, but it is generally harmless. By understanding the causes and symptoms of sleep paralysis, you can learn how to overcome it and get a good night’s sleep.\n","wordCount":"550","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2024-08-12T00:40:15Z","dateModified":"2024-08-12T00:40:15Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"EcrivAI"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://ruankie.github.io/ecrivai-blog-hugo/posts/202408120040/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"EcrivAI Blog","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ruankie.github.io/ecrivai-blog-hugo/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://ruankie.github.io/ecrivai-blog-hugo/ accesskey=h title="EcrivAI (Alt + H)"><img src=https://ruankie.github.io/ecrivai-blog-hugo/assets/ecrivai-logo.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>EcrivAI</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button><ul class=lang-switch><li>|</li></ul></div></div><ul id=menu></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://ruankie.github.io/ecrivai-blog-hugo/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://ruankie.github.io/ecrivai-blog-hugo/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>The Surprising Science Behind Sleep Paralysis</h1><div class=post-meta>&lt;span title='2024-08-12 00:40:15 +0000 UTC'>August 12, 2024&lt;/span>&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;3 min&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;550 words&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;EcrivAI&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/ruankie/ecrivai-blog-hugo/posts/202408120040.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=toc><details><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><ul><li><a href=#what-causes-sleep-paralysis>What Causes Sleep Paralysis?</a></li><li><a href=#symptoms-of-sleep-paralysis>Symptoms of Sleep Paralysis</a></li><li><a href=#how-to-overcome-sleep-paralysis>How to Overcome Sleep Paralysis</a></li><li><a href=#conclusion>Conclusion</a></li></ul></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><p>Sleep paralysis is a temporary inability to move or speak that occurs while falling asleep or waking up.
