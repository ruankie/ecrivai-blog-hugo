### Introduction

In a world where food is often seen as a source of comfort, indulgence, or even anxiety, it can be challenging to develop a healthy relationship with it. Mindful eating, a practice that involves paying attention to the experience of eating without judgment, can help us overcome these challenges and cultivate a more positive relationship with food.

### What is Mindful Eating?

Mindful eating involves bringing awareness to the experience of eating, from the moment we start to prepare our food to the moment we finish our meal. It encourages us to:

- **Engage our senses:** Notice the colors, textures, aromas, and flavors of our food, enhancing our enjoyment of the meal.
- **Slow down and savor each bite:** Take time to chew thoroughly and appreciate the taste and nourishment of our food.
- **Avoid distractions:** Turn off the TV, put away our phones, and focus on the act of eating.
- **Be non-judgemental:** Observe our thoughts and feelings about food without judgment or criticism.
