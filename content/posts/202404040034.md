To practice mindfulness meditation, simply sit in a comfortable position, close your eyes, and focus on your breath. Notice the rise and fall of your chest, the feeling of the air passing through your nostrils. If your mind wanders, gently bring it back to your breath.

Continue scanning your body until you reach the top of your head.
