Eating healthy doesn't have to break the bank. It is possible to get all the nutrients you need and still stick to a budget. With a few simple strategies, you can eat healthy while keeping your food costs low.

## Planning is Key

The first and most important step to eating healthy on a budget is to plan ahead. Planning meals and making grocery lists helps to avoid impulse purchases and overspending. Before heading to the store, take a few moments to decide what you will need for the week. Consider which meals you will be cooking and plan to utilize leftovers. Take stock of what you already have in the pantry and fridge and make sure you donâ€™t buy duplicate items.

## Shop Smart

Buying in bulk is a great way to save money on healthy foods. Look for items that are on sale or in season. Frozen foods, such as vegetables, fruits, and lean proteins, are often cheaper than fresh produce and can have a long shelf life. Canned items, such as beans and tomatoes, are also cost-effective options. When shopping for fresh produce, buy what is in season and choose items that are nutrient-dense, like dark leafy greens, sweet potatoes, and berries. 

## Cook at Home

Cooking at home rather than eating out is a great way to save money while still eating healthy. Preparing your own meals allows you to control the ingredients and portion sizes. It also eliminates the temptation of unhealthy options, such as fast food.

## Get Creative

Finding ways to add variety to your meals on a budget can be challenging. Whole grains, such as quinoa, oats, and brown rice, are inexpensive and full of nutrients. Legumes, like lentils and beans, are also a good source of protein and fiber and are very affordable. Other budget-friendly ingredients include eggs, peanut butter, and plain Greek yogurt. Try to incorporate as many of these items as possible into your meals. 

## Stick to Your Budget

The most important part of eating healthy on a budget is to stay organized and stick to your budget. Meal planning and shopping smartly can help you save money and still eat healthy. Try to be creative and find ways to add variety to your meals. With a few simple strategies, you can enjoy healthy meals without breaking the bank.
