## Ancient Legends and Mysterious Beginnings

The earliest legends surrounding coffee's discovery trace back to the 9th century in the Ethiopian highlands. A goat herder named Kaldi is said to have noticed his goats behaving unusually energetic after consuming the berries of a certain shrub. Intrigued, he tried the berries himself and experienced a similar surge of energy. Word of this miraculous plant spread, and soon, coffee beans were being consumed by Sufi monks in Yemen to stay awake during long nights of prayer.

From the Arabian Peninsula, coffee's popularity rapidly expanded throughout the Middle East and North Africa. Coffeehouses sprang up in major cities, becoming hubs of social interaction, intellectual discourse, and political intrigue.
