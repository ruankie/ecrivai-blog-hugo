Laughter is a universal language that transcends cultural boundaries. It is an involuntary response to humor, joy, or absurdity that brings about a range of physical, emotional, and social benefits. While we often associate laughter with lighthearted moments, research has revealed its profound impact on our well-being, making it an invaluable tool for improving our overall health and happiness.

### The Physical Benefits of Laughter
