Eating mindfully has become an increasingly popular topic in recent years. It’s a way of eating that encourages you to be more aware of the food you’re consuming and the impact it has on your body. Mindful eating is about being more present and conscious of the food you’re eating, and the resulting health benefits can be tremendous. 

## What is Mindful Eating?

Mindful eating is an approach to eating that emphasizes being aware of your body’s hunger and fullness cues, and allowing yourself to enjoy and savor the food that you’re eating. It’s about being conscious of the physical and emotional sensations that come with eating. Instead of eating mindlessly or in a rush, mindful eating encourages you to take your time, pay attention to the flavors and textures of the food, and really appreciate it.
