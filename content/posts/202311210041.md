Organic gardening is an increasingly popular way to grow fruits, vegetables, and herbs without the use of synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, or other chemicals. It is a sustainable and eco-friendly way to produce nutritious food and plants while preserving the environment. Organic gardening is not only great for the environment, but it also provides many benefits for you and your garden. 

## What is Organic Gardening?
Organic gardening is the practice of growing plants without the use of synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, or other chemicals. Instead, organic gardening relies on natural materials such as compost, mulch, and manure to nourish the soil and plants. This type of gardening also encourages beneficial insects and other organisms to help keep pests and diseases at bay.

Organic gardening is also based on a set of principles that promote sustainability and environmental stewardship. These principles include composting, crop rotation, avoiding monocultures, and minimizing the use of water and other resources. By following these principles, organic gardeners can create a beautiful and productive garden that is good for the environment and their own health.
