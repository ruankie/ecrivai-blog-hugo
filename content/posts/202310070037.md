- Calcium: Calcium is needed for bone and teeth health, and can be found in green leafy vegetables, fortified plant milks, tofu, and almonds.

- Iron: Iron helps carry oxygen around the body and can be found in legumes, dried fruit, nuts, and fortified cereals.

- Vitamin B12: Vitamin B12 helps keep the nervous system healthy and can be found in fortified plant milks, fortified yeast spreads, and fortified breakfast cereals.

- Vitamin D: Vitamin D helps your body absorb calcium and can be obtained from fortified plant milks, fortified breakfast cereals, and supplements.
