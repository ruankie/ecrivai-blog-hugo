The way we talk to ourselves has a profound impact on our thoughts, feelings, and actions. Negative self-talk can hold us back, while positive self-talk can empower us to reach our goals and live a more fulfilling life.

**The Problem with Negative Self-Talk**

Negative self-talk is a common problem that can stem from a variety of factors, such as:

When we engage in negative self-talk, we often:
