## Eiffel Tower

**The Tower's Intended Purpose:**

Contrary to popular belief, the Eiffel Tower was not initially conceived as a permanent structure but as a temporary exhibit for the 1889 World's Fair. Its bold design, intended to represent a giant industrial machine, was initially met with fierce criticism and even ridiculed as "an ugly iron monster."

**A Controversial Birth:**

The construction of the Eiffel Tower was a tumultuous process. Critics denounced its aesthetics, and residents of the surrounding neighborhood protested its construction, fearing it would ruin the city's skyline. Despite the opposition, the tower's architect, Gustave Eiffel, persevered, completing it in just two years.

## Stonehenge

**An Ancient Puzzle:**

Stonehenge, the enigmatic circle of towering stones in England, has fascinated scholars and visitors alike for centuries. Its origins and purpose remain shrouded in mystery, with theories ranging from an ancient astronomical observatory to a sacred temple.

The construction of the Great Wall was a massive undertaking, involving millions of workers and countless lives. The wall's design and construction methods evolved over time, incorporating techniques such as rammed earth, bricks, and stone.

The Taj Mahal, an architectural masterpiece in India, was built by Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal. Its stunning white marble facade and intricate details are a testament to the enduring power of love.

The construction of the Taj Mahal took over 20 years and involved thousands of artisans and craftsmen. Its design incorporates elements from Persian, Mughal, and Indian architectural styles, creating a harmonious blend of cultures.
